# EdgeX Project Roadmap

## 1. Project Vision

EdgeX aims to become the leading operating system for edge AI devices by providing a secure, efficient, and maintainable microkernel architecture that addresses the limitations of existing systems. Our vision is to create an OS that:

- Delivers true microkernel performance without compromising on speed
- Implements quantum-secure cryptography as a core feature
- Provides Git-inspired synchronization for models and patches
- Supports deterministic, real-time scheduling for critical edge applications
- Remains readable and maintainable for developers
- Offers multi-architecture support for modern computing platforms

EdgeX is designed for a future where edge computing and AI are ubiquitous, security threats are sophisticated, and system reliability is non-negotiable.

## 2. Current Status

EdgeX is currently in early development with the following components functioning:

- Basic microkernel architecture with process isolation
- Initial IPC (Inter-Process Communication) subsystem
- Bootloader integration for x86_64 architecture
- Rudimentary file system implementation
- Memory management foundations
- Build system for cross-platform development
