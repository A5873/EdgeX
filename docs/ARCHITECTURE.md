# EdgeX Architecture

EdgeX is designed as a secure, efficient, and decentralized microkernel-based operating system for edge AI devices. This document outlines the high-level architecture of the system.

## Core Principles

1. **Microkernel Architecture** - Keep the kernel small with minimal privileged code
2. **Strong Security Model** - Quantum-secure cryptography and fine-grained permissions
3. **Decentralized Design** - Git-like synchronization for updates and AI models
4. **Deterministic Behavior** - Predictable, real-time capable scheduling
5. **Maintainable Design** - Clean, well-documented code that others can understand

## System Layers

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

The lowest level of EdgeX provides abstractions for hardware-specific functions:

- Interrupt handling
- Memory management
- Device drivers
- Architecture-specific code (ARM64, RISC-V, x86_64)

### 2. Kernel Layer

The microkernel provides essential services:

- Task scheduling and management
- IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Memory protection and isolation
- Security policy enforcement
- Resource accounting

### 3. System Services Layer

User-mode services providing higher-level functionality:

- File system access
- Network stack
- Device management
- Security services (authentication, authorization)
- Update/sync engine

### 4. Application Layer

User applications and AI model execution environment:

- Application runtime
- Model loader and executor
- User interfaces
- Development tools

## IPC Subsystem

The Inter-Process Communication subsystem is a critical component enabling secure communication between tasks:

- **Mutexes**: For exclusive access to shared resources
- **Semaphores**: For synchronization and resource counting
- **Events**: For signaling between tasks with various reset modes
- **Message Queues**: Priority-based message passing with flow control
- **Shared Memory**: Efficient data sharing with controlled access

## Security Architecture

Security in EdgeX is designed with the following components:

- **Secure Boot**: Ensuring system integrity from boot
- **Memory Protection**: Preventing unauthorized access across process boundaries
- **Quantum-Secure Cryptography**: Future-proof cryptographic primitives
- **Fine-grained Permissions**: Least-privilege access control
- **Secure IPC**: Protected communication channels
- **Formal Verification**: Critical components verified for correctness

## Synchronization Engine

EdgeX includes a Git-like synchronization engine for:

- System updates
- AI model distribution
- Configuration management
- Decentralized collaboration

## Development Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core kernel functionality and IPC
2. **Phase 2**: Security infrastructure and formal verification
3. **Phase 3**: System services and synchronization engine
4. **Phase 4**: AI runtime and model management
5. **Phase 5**: User interfaces and developer tools

## Implementation Notes

- Kernel core in C for performance and control
- Crypto modules in Rust for memory safety
- Focus on minimizing attack surface
- Emphasis on testing and verification
